## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript promises and DOM Manipulation
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/declarations/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use JavaScript promises in real time. Starting from how to send a get request ending with manipulating how the data is displayed on my page.

### Continued development

I will always take every opportunity to hone my JaaScript Skills from intermediate to advanced concepts. I hope to grow into frameworks as I build.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com) - This helped me learn Sass as I build.
